This is an Android application for a admission system in a University.
(Here i designed it for my CUET which can be modified)

<p>This app was built as an extension of a Database Management System Project. Admission form, Notice and Information system are added in this mobile application. Actually, the app is designed in HTML,CSS and Javascript, and Phonegap Framework was used to port it for android. Main Database was hosted on awardspace.net for one year. Code has to be modified for your own site.</p>
